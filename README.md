# Project Phoenix MMI

Project Phoenix MMI is a research and development initiative focused on documenting the Audi MMI 2G High platform and building safe, reproducible tooling for firmware analysis.

## Current phase

**M1 — Firmware Archaeology**

The foundation, update model and principal-image fingerprinting are complete. Session 008 confirms a 71,245-byte relocated sparse-row bitmap region and publishes the first confidence-graded end-to-end firmware operational graph. Glyph/browser semantics remain probable until a renderer consumer is decoded.

## First milestone

**M1 — Firmware Archaeology**

The goal of M1 is to:

- inventory the three MMI 5570 update discs;
- identify package, executable, resource, filesystem, and metadata formats;
- document the update process and module relationships;
- create reproducible manifests and analysis notes;
- avoid vehicle-side testing until the update chain and recovery requirements are understood.

## Repository structure

## Research evidence levels

Every technical claim should be marked as one of:

- **CONFIRMED** — directly verified by reproducible evidence;
- **PROBABLE** — strongly supported but not fully verified;
- **HYPOTHESIS** — plausible and awaiting evidence;
- **DISPROVED** — tested and shown to be incorrect.

## Safety and scope

This project does not publish copyrighted firmware images, vehicle-specific secrets, Component Protection bypass instructions, immobilizer material, private identifiers, or instructions intended to defeat access controls.

Firmware images remain local research artifacts. The repository stores only independently created documentation, tools, metadata, hashes, and sanitized test fixtures.

## Guiding rule

> Understand first. Modify second.
